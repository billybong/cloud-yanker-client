===================

Your cut and paste clipboard. In the cloud! Very simple project to allow for copy pasting between multiple computers. The server is not secured in any way, so use at your own risk.

<h3>Build & run the client:</h3>
The client is simply an AutoHotKey script that talks to your clipboard. Edit the config.ini file and supply the server url as well as a user. Run the script with either ahk install or simply use the exe if not. Then use CTRL+ALT+Y to copy selected text to the backend, CTRL+ALT+P to paste from it.
